     * An Effect is incredibly broad and can best be summarized as follows:
     * Trainer cards are cards that have an effect.
     * Pokemon powers have an effect.
     * Some Pokemon attacks have an effect.
     * Essentially: An Effect is anything that immediatly affects the state of the Playing Field that is not an attack.
